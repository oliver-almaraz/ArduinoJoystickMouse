# Arduino Joystick Mouse
Create a simple mouse with **vertical and horizontal scroll** using two joysticks connected to an Arduino.

Thanks to [Shubham Santosh](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/shubhamsantosh99/joystick-controlled-mouse-af2939)
for the inspiration.

## Components:
- Dual axis + click Joystick **x2**
- Dupont male-to-female wires **x10*
- Any Arduino with at least:
    - 4 analog inputs
    - 4 left pins for 5v output and GND
    - Serial communication to a computer
    
 ## Wiring setup in \*.ino file.
 ## Instructions:
 Compile and upload \*.ino code to your board, find which serial port it's connected to, update Python script and run it.
 
 **Horizontal scroll may only work in Linux and macOS.
 
 Finally, create a setup prettier than mine:
